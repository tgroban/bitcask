# bitcask

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/go.mills.io/bitcask/v2.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mills.io/bitcask/v2)

A high performance Key/Value store written in [Go](https://golang.org) with a predictable read/write performance and high throughput. Uses a [Bitcask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcask) on-disk layout (LSM+WAL) similar to [Riak](https://riak.com/)

For a more feature-complete Redis-compatible server, distributed key/value store have a look at [Bitraft](https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitraft) which uses this library as its backend. Use [Bitcask](https://go.mills.io/bitcask/v2) as a starting point or if you want to embed in your application, use [Bitraft](https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitraft) if you need a complete server/client solution with high availability with a Redis-compatible API.

## Features

* Embedded (`import "go.mills.io/bitcask/v2"`)
* Builtin CLI (`bitcask`)
* Builtin Redis-compatible server (`bitcaskd`)
* Predictable read/write performance
* High throughput (See: [Performance](README.md#Performance) )
* Full Transactions support
* Low latency

## Is Bitcask right for my project?

__NOTE__: Please read this carefully to identify whether using Bitcask is
          suitable for your needs.

`bitcask` is a **great fit** for:

- Storing hundreds of thousands to millions of key/value pairs based on
  default configuration. With the default configuration (_configurable_)
  of 64 bytes per key and 64kB values, 1M keys would consume roughly ~600-700MB
  of memory ~65-70GB of disk storage. These are all configurable when you
  create a new database with `bitcask.Open(...)` with functional-style options
  you can pass with `WithXXX()`.

- As the backing store to a distributed key/value store. See for example the
  [bitraft](https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitraft) as an example of this.

- For high performance, low latency read/write workloads where you cannot fit
  a typical hash-map into memory, but require the highest level of performance
  and predicate read latency. Bitcask ensures only 1 read/write IOPS are ever
  required for reading and writing key/value pairs.

- As a general purpose embedded key/value store where you would have used
  [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt),
  [LevelDB](https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb),
  [BuntDB](https://github.com/tidwall/buntdb)
  or similar...

`bitcask` is not suited for:

- Storing billions of records
  The reason for this is the key-space is held in memory using radix tree.
  This means the more keys you have in your key space, the more memory is
  consumed. Consider using a disk-backed B-Tree like [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt)
  or [LevelDB](https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb) if you intend to store a
  large quantity of key/value pairs.

> Note however that storing large amounts of data in terms of value(s) is
> totally fine. In other wise thousands to millions of keys with large values
> will work just fine.

- Write intensive workloads. Due to the [Bitcask design](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf?source=post_page---------------------------)
  heavy write workloads that lots of key/value pairs will over time cause
  problems like "Too many open files" (#193) errors to occur. This can be mitigated by
  periodically compacting the data files by issuing a `.Merge()` operation however
  if key/value pairs do not change or are never deleted, as-in only new key/value
  pairs are ever written this will have no effect. Eventually you will run out
  of file descriptors!

> You should consider your read/write workloads carefully and ensure you set
> appropriate file descriptor limits with `ulimit -n` that suit your needs.

## Development

```sh
$ git clone https://git.mills.io/prologic/bitcask.git
$ make
```

## Install

```sh
$ go get go.mills.io/bitcask/v2
```

## Usage (library)

Install the package into your project:

```sh
$ go get go.mills.io/bitcask/v2
```

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"go.mills.io/bitcask/v2"
)

func main() {
    db, _ := bitcask.Open("/tmp/db")
    defer db.Close()
    db.Put([]byte("Hello"), []byte("World"))
    val, _ := db.Get([]byte("Hello"))
    log.Printf(string(val))
}
```

See the [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/go.mills.io/bitcask/v2) for further
documentation and other examples.

See also [examples](./examples)

## Usage (tool)

```sh
$ bitcask -p /tmp/db set Hello World
$ bitcask -p /tmp/db get Hello
World
```

## Usage (server)

There is also a builtin very  simple Redis-compatible server called `bitcaskd`:

```sh
$ ./bitcaskd ./tmp
INFO[0000] starting bitcaskd v0.0.7@146f777              bind=":6379" path=./tmp
```

Example session:

```sh
$ telnet localhost 6379
Trying ::1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
SET foo bar
+OK
GET foo
$3
bar
DEL foo
:1
GET foo
$-1
PING
+PONG
QUIT
+OK
Connection closed by foreign host.
```

## Docker

You can also use the [Bitcask Docker Image](https://cloud.docker.com/u/prologic/repository/docker/prologic/bitcask):

```sh
$ docker pull prologic/bitcask
$ docker run -d -p 6379:6379 prologic/bitcask
```

## Performance

```sh
$ make bench

For 128B values:

* ~1,000,000 reads/sec
* ~250,000 writes/sec
* ~1,100,000 scans/sec

The full benchmark above shows linear performance as you increase key/value sizes.

As far as benchmarks go, this is all contrived and generally not typical of any real workloads. These benchmarks were run on a 2022 Mac Studio M1 Max with 32GB of RAM. Your results may differ.
